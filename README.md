## About this project

- A small game project, to get used to making many small games end-to-end
- I tested out how easily I can make simple game graphics using Midjourney. Result: They were simple enough to make but consistency was still tricky: Creating the space ship, the asteroids and the explosion in the same style required several iterations. Midjourney also did not always listen to my commands the way I wanted to. (This was in August 2023. Need to revisit how the tech has evolved.)

## Platforms

- The game is built for Android
- The game can also be tested on Unity Desktop

## How to play

- Avoid the asteroids as the ships gets faster and faster.
- Stear the space ship using the virtual joystick on Unity Desktop or the touch controls on Android.
